# ChatAppDemo w/@DesignCodeTeam

In this application, I have created a basic chat application using Firebase Firestore and SwiftUI. In the project, Firestore is used for data reading and writing operations. Thanks to real-time updates, when a new message is sent or received, both the database and the messages in the application are updated instantly.

Take look at the [DesignCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz9XQy8PRpQ) YouTube channel for the tutorial.
